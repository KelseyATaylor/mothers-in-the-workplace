My Devmountain Data Analytics Capstone Project 2022

For this capstone project I utilized data cleaning with Excel and some Python in a Jupyter Notebook. 
To do my exploratory data analysis I loaded that cleaned excel sheet into a jupyter notebook and used Python and Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore the data and to get some preliminary visualizations made. 
With a better idea of what I was looking at, I loaded those excel files into Power BI where I completed the final visualizations. 

The associated files are committed to the repository. 

I hope you enjoy!
